<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Are Digital Signatures</strong></h1>
<p>A digital signature is a PKI-based digital certificate that authenticates the identity of the signer and ensures electronically transmitted documents and digital messages have not been forged or tampered with. Digital signatures are similar to physical signatures in the sense that both are unique to the signer, except that in the case of digitally signed documents, a digital signature offers far more security and the assurance of the document&rsquo;s origin, identity, and integrity. Based on the highest standard of security, digital signatures are legally binding in the United States and many other countries.</p>

<h3>What Is the Difference Between Digital Signatures and Electronic Signatures?</h3>
<p>Electronic signatures, commonly referred to as e-signatures, are a broad set of solutions that use an electronic process for accepting a document or transaction with a signature. As documents and communication are increasingly paperless, businesses and consumers worldwide have embraced the speed and convenience of electronic signatures. But there are many different types of electronic signatures, each allowing users to sign documents digitally and offering some degree of identity authentication.</p>
<p>Digital signatures are one of those electronic signature technologies and are the most secure type available. Digital signatures use PKI certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to ensure identity authentication and document integrity by encrypted binding of the signature to the document. Other, less secure electronic signature types may use common electronic authentication methods to verify the signer&rsquo;s identity, such as an email address, a corporate username/ID, or a phone number/PIN. As a result of different technical and security requirements, electronic signatures vary in industry, geographic, and legal acceptance. Digital signatures comply with the most demanding regulatory requirements, including the United States Federal ESIGN Act and other applicable international laws.</p>
<h3>What Does a Digital Signature Look Like?</h3>
<p>Since the heart of a digital signature is the PKI certificate, which is software code, the digital signature itself is not inherently visible. However, document platforms may provide easily recognizable proof that a document has been digitally signed. This representation and the certificate details shown varies by document type and processing platform. For example, an Adobe PDF that has been digitally signed displays a seal icon and blue ribbon and across the top of the document that shows the document signer&rsquo;s name and the certificate issuer.</p>
