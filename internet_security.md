<p>The major difference between active and passive attacks is that in active attacks the attacker intercepts the connection and modifies the information. Whereas, in a passive attack, the attacker intercepts the transit information with the intention of reading and analyzing the information not for altering it.</p>
<p>ks and vulnerabilities present to corrupt and breach the system security. Security attacks are the computer attacks that compromise the security of the system. Conceptually, the security attacks can be classified into two types that are active and passive attacks where the attacker gains illegal access to the system&rsquo;s resources.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Active attacks</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>are the attacks in which the attacker tries to modify the information or creates a false message. The prevention of these attacks is quite difficult because of a broad range of potential physical, network and software vulnerabilities. Instead of prevention, it emphasizes on the detection of the attack and recovery from any disruption or delay caused by it.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5408" src="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/active-attack-modified.jpg" alt="active attack" width="593" height="270" srcset="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/active-attack-modified.jpg 593w, https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/active-attack-modified-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" />An active attack usually requires more effort and often more dangerous implication. When the hacker attempts to attack, the victim gets aware of it.</p>
<p>The active attacks are in the form of interruption, modification and fabrication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interruption</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is known as masquerade attack in which unauthorized attacker tries to pose as another entity.</li>
<li><strong>Modification</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>can be done using two ways replay attack and alteration. In the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>replay</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>attack, a sequence of events or some data units is captured and resent by them. While<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>alteration</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of the message involves some change to the original message, either one of them can cause alteration.</li>
<li><strong>Fabrication</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>causes<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Denial Of Service (DOS)</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>attacks in which attacker strive to prevent licit users from accessing some services, which they are permitted to or in simple words the attacker gain access to the network and then lock the authorized user out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Definition of Passive Attacks</h3>
<p><strong>Passive attacks</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>are the attacks where the attacker indulges in unauthorized eavesdropping, just monitoring the transmission or gathering information. The eavesdropper does not make any changes to the data or the system.</p>
<p>Unlike active attack, the passive attack is hard to detect because it doesn&rsquo;t involve any alteration in the data or system resources. Thus, the attacked entity doesn&rsquo;t get any clue about the attack. Although, it can be prevented using encryption methods in which the data is firstly encoded in the unintelligible language at the sender&rsquo;s end and then at the receivers end it is again converted into human understandable language.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5410" src="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/passive-attack-modified.jpg" alt="passive attack" width="600" height="266" srcset="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/passive-attack-modified.jpg 600w, https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/passive-attack-modified-300x133.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />In this way, at the time of transit, the message is in an unintelligible form which could not be understood by the hackers. That is the reason, in passive attacks, the prevention has more concern than detection. The passive attacks entangle the open ports that are not protected by firewalls. The attacker continuously searches for the vulnerabilities and once it is found the attacker gains access to network and system.</p>
<p>The passive attacks are further classified into two types, first is the release of message content and second is traffic analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>release of message content</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>can be expressed with an example, in which the sender wants to send a confidential message or email to the receiver. The sender doesn&rsquo;t want the contents of that message to be read by some interceptor.</li>
<li>By using encryption a message could be masked in order to prevent the extraction of the information from the message, even if the message is captured. Though still attacker can analyse the traffic and observe the pattern to retrieve the information. This type of passive attack refers to as<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>traffic analysis</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>All about malware</h2>
<p>You know how every year the medical community campaigns for everyone to get a flu shot? That&rsquo;s because flu outbreaks typically have a season&mdash;a time of year when they start spreading and infecting people.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are no predictable seasonal infections for PCs, smartphones, tablets, and enterprise networks. For them, it&rsquo;s always flu season. But instead of suffering chills and body aches, users can fall ill from a kind of machine malady&mdash;malware.</p>
<p>Each type of malware infection has its own methods of attack&mdash;from stealthy and sneaky to subtle like a sledgehammer. But if knowledge is power, as a preventative inoculation against infection, we offer here a short<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybersecurity</a><span>&nbsp;</span>course on malware, what it is, its symptoms, how you get it, how to deal with it, and how to avoid it in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-malware">What is malware?</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malware</a>, or &ldquo;malicious software,&rdquo; is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems.</p>
<p>Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty, malware seeks to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often by taking partial control over a device&rsquo;s operations. Like the human flu, it interferes with normal functioning.</p>
<p>The motives behind malware vary. Malware can be about making money off you, sabotaging your ability to get work done, making a political statement, or just bragging rights. Although malware cannot damage the physical hardware of systems or network equipment (with one known exception&mdash;see the Google Android section below), it can steal, encrypt, or delete your data, alter or hijack core computer functions, and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or permission.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-tell-if-i-have-a-malware-infection">How can I tell if I have a malware infection?</h2>
<p>Malware can reveal itself with many different aberrant behaviors. Here are a few<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/05/how-to-tell-if-youre-infected-with-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telltale signs that you have malware</a><span>&nbsp;</span>on your system:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Your computer slows down.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>One of malware&rsquo;s side effects is to reduce the speed of your<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/operating-system-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operating system</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(OS), whether you&rsquo;re navigating the Internet or just using your local applications, usage of your system&rsquo;s resources appears abnormally high. You might even notice your computer&rsquo;s fan whirring away at full speed&mdash;a good indicator that something is taking up system resources in the background. This tends to happen when your computer has been roped into a botnet; i.e. a network of enslaved computers used to perform<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/ddos/" target="_self">DDoS</a><span>&nbsp;</span>attacks, blast out<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/spam/" target="_self">spam</a>, or mine<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptojacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>.</li>
<li><b>Your screen is inundated with annoying ads.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Unexpected pop-up ads are a typical sign of a malware infection. They&rsquo;re especially associated with a form of malware known as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adware</a>. What&rsquo;s more, pop-ups usually come packaged with other hidden malware threats. So if you see something akin to &ldquo;CONGRATULATIONS, YOU&rsquo;VE WON A FREE PSYCHIC READING!&rdquo; in a pop-up, don&rsquo;t click on it. Whatever free prize the ad promises,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2018/01/how-to-remove-adware-from-your-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will cost you plenty</a>.</li>
<li><b>Your system crashes.<span>&nbsp;</span></b>This can come as a freeze or a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), the latter occurs on Windows systems after encountering a fatal error.</li>
<li><b>You notice a mysterious loss of disk space.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>This could be due to a bloated malware squatter, hiding in your hard drive aka<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2018/01/how-to-remove-adware-from-your-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bundleware</a>.</li>
<li><b>There&rsquo;s a weird increase in your system&rsquo;s Internet activity.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Take Trojans for example. Once a Trojan lands on a target computer, the next thing it does is reach out to the attacker&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command and control server</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(C&amp;C) to download a secondary infection, often ransomware. This could explain the spike in Internet activity. The same goes for botnets,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spyware</a>, and any other threat that requires back and forth communication with the C&amp;C servers.</li>
<li><b>Your browser settings change.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>If you notice your homepage changed or you have new toolbars, extensions, or plugins installed, then you might have some sort of malware infection. Causes vary, but this usually means you clicked on that &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; pop-up, which downloaded some<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/02/how-to-avoid-potentially-unwanted-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted software</a>.</li>
<li><b>Your antivirus product stops working</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and you cannot turn it back on, leaving you unprotected against the sneaky malware that disabled it.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>You lose access to your files or your entire computer.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>This is symptomatic of a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/" target="_self">ransomware</a><span>&nbsp;</span>infection. The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/hacker/" target="_self">hackers</a><span>&nbsp;</span>announce themselves by leaving a ransom note on your desktop or changing your desktop wallpaper itself in to a ransom note (see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/gandcrab/" target="_self">GandCrab)</a>. In the note, the perpetrators typically inform you that your data has been encrypted and demand a ransom payment in exchange for decrypting your files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if everything seems to be working just fine on your system, don&rsquo;t get complacent, because no news isn&rsquo;t necessarily good news. Powerful malware can hide deep in your computer, evading detection, and going about its dirty business without raising any red flags. While we&rsquo;ve provided a quick malware spotter&rsquo;s guide, it really takes the unfaltering eye of a good cybersecurity program to detect malware on your system (more on that later).</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-malware">How do I get malware?</h2>
<p>The two most common ways that malware accesses your system are the Internet and email. So basically, anytime you&rsquo;re connected online, you&rsquo;re vulnerable.</p>
<p>Malware can penetrate your computer when (deep breath now) you surf through hacked websites, view a legitimate site serving malicious ads, download infected files, install programs or apps from unfamiliar provide, open a malicious email attachment (<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threats/malspam/" target="blank">malspam</a>), or pretty much everything else you download from the web on to a device that lacks a quality anti-malware security application.</p>
<p>Malicious apps can hide in seemingly legitimate applications, especially when they are downloaded from websites or direct links (in an email, text, or chat message) instead of an official app store. Here it&rsquo;s important to look at the warning messages when installing applications, especially if they seek permission to access your email or other personal information.&nbsp;</p>
